# Graph-DataStructure

# Introduction

The **Social Network Manager** is a Java-based console application that simulates a social network using a graph data structure. Each individual is represented as a node, and their friendships are edges connecting these nodes. The application allows users to manage and explore relationships within this network.

# Key Features and Explanation

**1.Add individuals:**
  Allows users to add new people to the social network. Each individual is represented as a node in the graph.
  
**2.Create friendships:**
  Enables users to define a friendship between two individuals. This creates an edge between the corresponding nodes in the graph.
  
**3.Check if two individuals are connected:**
  Users can verify if a relationship exists between two individuals, either directly (a single edge) or indirectly (via other connections). This uses a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS).
  
**4.View all connections in the social network:**
Displays the entire social network in terms of nodes and their connections, making it easy to visualize relationships between individuals.

# Why This Application

Social networks play a significant role in our digital lives, making it valuable to understand their structure and behaviour for both personal and professional purposes. This application demonstrates how graph algorithms work in real-world scenarios, provides an interactive tool for managing and analyzing relationships within a network, and enhances learning by applying theoretical graph concepts to a practical, relatable problem.
